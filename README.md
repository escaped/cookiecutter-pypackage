## Quickstart

Get the latest version of [Cruft] (or [Cookiecutter])
I recommend [pipx] to install it into a global isolated environment.

```sh
pipx install cruft
```

Generate a new python package

```sh
cruft create https://github.com/escaped/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
cd <chosen project slug>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial project structure"
```

### Publish releases to pypi

In order get automatic releases to [pypi] you need to add your pypi access token to the secrets github (named `PYPI_TOKEN`).
Instructions can be found here: [python.org](https://packaging.python.org/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#saving-credentials-on-github).

### Autoupdate template

This cookiecutter template comes with an auto update feature if the project was created using [cruft].
A GitHub action automatically checks for updates and creates a pull request.

It is required to add a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
as github secret to the repository (named `AUTO_UPDATE_GITHUB_TOKEN`).
While creating the access token, the following permissions have to be granted

* repo
* workflow
